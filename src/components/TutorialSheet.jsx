      <h2>Welcome to Observo!</h2>
      <p>Observo is your new one-stop shop for building healthy habits!</p>
      <p>
        You can track your habits, and cross them off everyday and win EXP
        points in return. These EXP points are used to level up your own Virtual
        Pet! Your pet is very impressionable though, so make sure to log how
        you're feeling every day in the app too. Watch your pet mimic how feel.
        As your pet levels up you gain access to various different "healthy
        habit programs" which will aid you in picking up new habits in your
        daily life by giving you small, incremental steps!
      </p>
      <p>
        To get started swipe to the next slide, name your pet and start
        tracking!
